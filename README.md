# Fleet-management-with-Power-BI
In this project, I leveraged Power BI to address several challenges related to fleet management within a transport company. The steps undertaken in this project include understanding the problem, gathering the requirements, creating a model, cleaning the data, and finally, creating measures and visualizations.

## Problem Statement
Our transport company faced a multitude of inefficiencies and challenges:

- **Inefficient Fleet Management**: Our vast fleet of trailers was being managed without the aid of real-time information and automated management mechanisms, leading to inefficient operations.

- **Inconsistent TMS Data**: Our Transport Management System (TMS) frequently contained inconsistencies, requiring constant verification and checks, thus draining our resources.

- **Over-reliance on Manual Methods**: Managers relied heavily on daily reports and manual yard checks to obtain clear information about the status of trailers and their freight, a process that was both inefficient and prone to human error.

- **Delayed Data Utilization**: Our approach did not allow for real-time use of data. The team had to wait for manually curated reports, hampering immediate decision-making.

- **Manual Analysis and Updates**: Our current process involved manual analysis of data, updating it into Excel spreadsheets, and having a coordinator fix inconsistencies in the TMS. Although functional, this method was extremely time-consuming.

- **Lack of Real-Time Information**: Despite our best efforts, our management team was unable to access real-time information, slowing down the decision-making process and negatively impacting operational efficiency.

## Approach
Since the management of the transport company needed a fast and modulable solution, We Borowed a few concept from the Agile methodologie.
We gather the folowing requirements :
| User Story # | User Story | Priority |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| User Story 1: VP of Operations | As a VP of Operations, I want to see high-level metrics about trailer utilization, so that I can make informed strategic decisions about our operations. | $$ |
| User Story 2: Director of Operations | As a Director of Operations, I want to be informed on the availability of equipment, so that I can effectively manage resources and plan operations. | $$$ |
| User Story 3: Warehouse Manager | As a Warehouse Manager, I want to have a view of the progress of work and amount of work that needs to be done, so that I can manage warehouse operations efficiently. | $$ |
| User Story 4: Warehouse Foreman | As a Warehouse Foreman, I want to know about the work my team needs to get done, so that I can assign tasks effectively and manage my team's workload. | $$$ |
| User Story 5: Customer Service Manager | As a Customer Service Manager, I want to know the overall service level and have a peek at work in progress for the customer, so that I can ensure high service standards and effectively manage customer expectations. | $$ |
| User Story 6: Customer Service Representative | As a Customer Service Representative, I want to be able to answer customers about the status of freight inside a trailer, so that I can provide timely and accurate information to customers. | $$$ |



## Data Cleaning and features engineering
i curently don<t have authorisation to share the raw data for the project  but i will mdo my best to create a similar dataset in the furtur
 Here is a description of  the data that we used for this project
                 
**TMS_Query**: This table contains a query from our database and holds information about all the company's equipment.       

  

```powerquery
let
    Source = Sql.Database("srvmsqltrsp1", "TMS", [Query="Select * from [TMS].[dbo].[Vw_Web_TrailersFrames]"]),
    #"Filtered Rows" = Table.SelectRows(Source, each ([IsTrailer] = 1) and ([DateLastUsed] <> null) and ([Rem_Actif] = 1) and ([AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 1015 GOLF LINKS RD, ANCASTER (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 1070 REST ACRES RD, PARIS (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 11250 Chemin de la CÃ´te-de-Liesse, LACHINE (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 11775 BRAMALEA RD, BRAMPTON (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 1200 50e Avenue, LACHINE (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 1200 BRANT ST UNIT A4, BURLINGTON (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 145 CARRIER DRIVE, ETOBICOKE (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 1735 KIPLING AVE, ETOBICOKE (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 1800 46, LACHINE (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 199 Summerlea Road, BRAMPTON (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 200 Westcreek Blvd, BRAMPTON (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 2054 Joyceville Rd, JOYCEVILLE (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 206497 HWY 26, MEAFORD (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 20775 RUE DAOUST, SAINTE ANNE DE BELLEVUE (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 2190 BOUL DAGENAIS OUEST, LAVAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 3200 Chemin de la baronne, VARENNES (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 3353 BOUL DES SOURCES, DOLLARD DES ORMEAUX (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 3465 WYECROFT RD, OAKVILLE (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 3500 FAIRWAY 7275, LACHINE (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 3500 RUE FAIRWAY, LACHINE (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 3520 BOUL ST-JOSEPH EST, MONTREAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 375 CHEMIN SAINT FRANCOIS OUEST, SAINT FRANCOIS DE MONTMAGNY (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 381 BOUL DES LAURENTIDES, LAVAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 4041 RUE WELLINGTON, VERDUN (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 4145 Saint-Elzear Ouest, LAVAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 5555 Royalmount, MONT ROYAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 60 DRIVER RD, BRAMPTON (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 666 WEST SAINT-MARTIN BOULEVARD, LAVAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 700 AV BEAUMONT, MONTREAL (QC)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 7380 Bren Road, MISSISSAUGA (ON)" and [AddressLastUsed] <> "Ongoing - 9501 Highway 50, KLEINBURG (ON)")),

**Trailer Issues**: This table, derived from an Excel sheet, is where coordinators compile issues about trailers. For example, it contains updates about when safety inspections are needed.
```powerquery
  let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Users\didierl\OneDrive - L TRANSPORT \Yard Audit.xlsm"), null, true),
    issues_Table = Source{[Item="issues",Kind="Table"]}[Data],

    #"Removed Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"Column4", "Column5", "Column6", "Column7", "Column8"}),
    #"Replaced Value" = Table.ReplaceValue(#"Removed Columns",null,"",Replacer.ReplaceValue,{"3500 FAIRWAY", "1800 46TH AVE", "1212 32ND AVE"})
in
    #"Replaced Value"
  ```
**Locations**: This table provides a list of locations where trailers can be, including client yards, our yard, and vendor yards.
``` powerquery
  let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Users\didierl\OneDrive - L TRANSPORT \Location.xlsx"), null, true),
    Table1_Table = Source{[Item="Table1",Kind="Table"]}[Data],
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Table1_Table,{{"Company", type text}, {"Address", type text}, {"Approved drop location", type text}, {"Trailer Pool", Int64.Type}}),
    #"Removed Duplicates" = Table.Distinct(#"Changed Type", {"Company"}),
    #"Replaced Value" = Table.ReplaceValue(#"Removed Duplicates",null,"No",Replacer.ReplaceValue,{"Approved drop location"})
in
    #"Replaced Value"
  ```
